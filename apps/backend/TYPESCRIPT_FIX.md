# TypeScript Build Fix for Render Platform

## Problem
The TypeScript build was failing on Render with errors:
- `error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'jest'`
- `error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'node'`

## Root Cause
Even though the `render.yaml` configuration used `npm ci --production=false` to install devDependencies, there were timing and environment issues that prevented the TypeScript types from being properly available during the build process.

## Solution

### 1. Type Verification Script (`scripts/verify-types.sh`)
- Checks if required TypeScript types are installed
- Automatically reinstalls missing types if needed
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Render-Specific Build Script (`scripts/build-render.sh`)
- Temporarily sets NODE_ENV to development during dependency installation
- Ensures devDependencies are installed regardless of environment settings
- Runs type verification before building
- Restores original NODE_ENV for the actual build

### 3. Updated Build Commands
- `build:verified`: Local build with type verification
- `build:render`: Render-specific build process
- Updated `render.yaml` to use the specialized build process

### 4. GitHub Workflow Updates
- Updated CI/CD to use verified build process for consistency

## Usage

### Local Development
```bash
npm run build:verified  # Build with type verification
npm run verify-types    # Just verify types
```

### Render Platform
The platform automatically uses `npm run build:render` as configured in `render.yaml`.

## Files Modified
- `engine/package.json`: Added new build scripts
- `engine/scripts/verify-types.sh`: Type verification script
- `engine/scripts/build-render.sh`: Render-specific build script  
- `render.yaml`: Updated build command
- `.github/workflows/engine.yml`: Updated to use verified build

## Testing
The solution handles these scenarios:
- ✅ Normal build with all types installed
- ✅ Build with missing types (auto-recovery)
- ✅ Build with NODE_ENV=production (temporary override)
- ✅ Consistent behavior between local and Render environments
